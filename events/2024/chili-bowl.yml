      The Chili Bowl is held every January at the Tulsa Expo Center in Tulsa,
      Oklahoma. The biggest midget race of the year, it attracts hundreds of
      drivers from all types of racing attempting to work their way through a
      week of preliminary rounds and an alphabet soup of main events to get to
      the 55-lap A main.
